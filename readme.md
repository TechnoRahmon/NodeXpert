## How to Make a New Build

To make a new build of the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:
    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your current directory to the project directory by running the following command:
    ```
    cd path/to/repository
    ```

3. **Run the Build Script**: Execute the `build.sh` script to initiate the build process. Enter the following command:
    ```
    ./build.sh
    ```
    This script automates the build process, creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, building the executable, and generating a log file (`build.log`).

4. **Verify Build Status**: After the script completes execution, verify the build status by checking the generated log file (`build.log`). If any errors occurred during the build process, review the log file for troubleshooting.

5. **Access the Executable**: Upon successful completion of the build, navigate to the `dist` directory. Here, you'll find the generated executable file named `NodeXpert.exe`.

6. **Run the Application**: Double-click the `NodeXpert.exe` file to launch the application.

7. **Enjoy!**: Congratulations! You have successfully made a new build of the application. Enjoy using it!

## Usage

1. Upon launching **NodeXpert**, you will be presented with a graphical user interface (GUI) showing the list of installed Node.js versions.
2. Use the buttons and options provided to manage the Node.js versions as needed. You can switch between versions, add notes for each node version, and perform other actions.
